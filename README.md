# dotfiles
This repository contains the dotfiles I use in my personal computer and in [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
It is managed by [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), and it's much easier to use than my old ansible setup.
Since most devcontainers have `bash` as their default shell, we can exploit this by having devcontainer specific setups in .bashrc, and local setups in .zshrc.
The install.sh script (executed by default in devcontainers) has been generated by using the [following instructions](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/machines/containers-and-vms/).

Some useful commands in case I forgot how to use chezmoi:
```bash
# cz is an alias for chezmoi
cz apply # Syncs the dotfiles
cz edit # Edits the dotfile and adds it to git
cz diff # Previews the differences between the stored state and the current state
```

The .chezmoiscripts directory contains scripts that will be executed every time they change (run\_once\_). We can use them to manage the system packages.
